# Abaqus-UEL-Subroutine
UEL refers to User-Defined Elements Abaqus subroutine, which are used to implement element types not found in the Abaqus element library. This project assists in writing a UEL subroutine. The subroutine is ideal for defining custom element shape functions. This subroutine is highly advanced in Abaqus and is designed for experienced users. In this project, we've made it easier for you to write such a complex subroutine.

The attached files are part of an educational package, with the link provided on the left side. By following the link, you’ll gain access to the full training video, along with all the Abaqus and Fortran files.
